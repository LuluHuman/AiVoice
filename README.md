# AI Voice

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Voice-to-Voice AI system like the ones in my video. With this setup, you will be able to convert Change the voice of a song.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the setup process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. OpenAI API Access: Make sure you have Ultimate Vocal Remover. If you don't have access, visit the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com) to sign up and get an API key.
2. Python: Install Python on your system. The setup process assumes you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
3. OpenAI Python Library: Install the OpenAI Python library using the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install openai
   ```

4. Sound Playback: Ensure your system has the necessary sound playback capabilities, such as speakers or headphones, to hear the generated speech.

## Setting Up Voice-to-Voice AI

Follow the steps below to set up Voice-to-Voice AI:

1. Clone the Repository: Clone the repository that contains the code for the Voice-to-Voice AI setup. Use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. API Configuration: Open the cloned repository and locate the `config.py` file. In this file, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable to your OpenAI API key.

3. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the repository's root directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Starting the Application: Run the application using the following command:

   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the Web Interface: Once the application is running, open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to access the web interface.

6. Using the Voice-to-Voice AI: In the web interface, enter the desired text input in the provided text box and click the "Submit" button. The AI model will process the input and generate natural-sounding speech output.

7. Listening to the Speech Output: Ensure that your system's sound playback is functioning correctly, and you have audio output devices connected. You should be able to hear the generated speech through your speakers or headphones.

## Customization and Advanced Options

The Voice-to-Voice AI setup can be customized and expanded based on your requirements. Here are some suggestions for further exploration:

- Speech Synthesis Parameters: The OpenAI API provides additional configuration options for speech synthesis, such as adjusting the speaking rate, pitch, and volume. Refer to the OpenAI API documentation for more details on how to customize the speech synthesis parameters.

- User Interface Enhancements: You can modify the web interface to suit your preferences or integrate the voice-to-voice functionality into your own applications or systems.

- Integration with other Services: Consider integrating the voice-to-voice functionality with other services or APIs to create more advanced applications. For example, you could combine the generated speech output with a voice recognition system or integrate it into a chatbot.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup process or while using the Voice-to-Voice AI system, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Verify API Key: Double-check that you have correctly set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in the `config.py` file.

2. Check Dependencies: Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed. Refer to the `requirements.txt` file
